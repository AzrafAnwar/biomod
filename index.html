         <h4 class="docs-header">So What's the Scoop on Microtubules?</h4>
                  <div class="row">
           <p>Microtubules are proteins found within our cells that serve as a component of the intracellular cytoskeleton. They are filamentous polymer proteins composed of subunits known as tubulin heterodimers and are involved in a variety of intracellular functions ranging from cell division to intracellular transport. </p><br>
           <p>Under in vivo conditions, tubulin heterodimers are formed from α- and β-tubulin molecules spontaneously binding together. These heterodimers are organized into functional microtubules within the cell through nucleation and polymerization. Microtubule organizing centers, or MTOCs, containing another type of tubulin known as γ-tubulin, form zones within the cell from which microtubules can grow by forming protofilaments which can then combine to form microtubules. The energy for these heterodimers binding on to one another is provided through through the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP present within the structure of the heterodimers and cell cytoplasm.</p><br>

               </div>
           <h6 align="center">Polymers of Heterodimers</h6>
           <br><p>Under in vitro conditions, nucleation and subsequent polymerization occurs spontaneously assuming an adequate supply of GTP is present; however, kinetic barriers involved in the reaction process maintains a low rate of microtubule assembly in vitro unless other nucleating agents such as DMSO or glycerol are present.</p><br>
           <p>During steady state conditions in both in vitro and in vivo, microtubules possess a property known as dynamic instability in which a single microtubule shifts between a growing and hrinking phase. Microtubules are also capable of combining end on end if their ends are capable of meeting within the solution they are present in. These characteristics mean that populations of microtubules will generally contain some microtubules that are growing and some that are shrinking; this allows for several interesting interactions within populations of microtubules and free tubulin heterodimers, including length redistribution, seed growth and annealing. </p><br>

               </div>
           <h6 align="center">Unstable at Equilibrium</h6><br>
           <br><p>These are interactions that would allow us to grow LONGER microtubules if manipulated correctly. But why are we interested in longer microtubules? We stated before that microtubules form a part of the intracellular cytoskeleton. More specifically, they form a network of tubules that span the cell and provide it structural stability. This network also serves a highway through which cellular loads can be shuttled around the cell by travelling along the length of the microtubule.</p><br>
           <p>It achieves this by working in tandem with kinesin, a motor protein capable of attaching itself onto a target molecule. Once bounded on to a microtubule’s surface, kinesin can take “steps” along the length of the microtubule by hydrolyzing ATP. If a load is bound to the kinesin molecule, this load molecule is carried along with the kinesin as well!</p><br>

           <h6 align="center">Kinesin Walks Across Microtubules</h6><br>
           <br><p>This particular property could be prove to extremely useful when engineering in the nano and micro scales. As microtubules can be used as tracks for carrying molecular cargo, they could potentially provide a highway for shuttling cargo within devices designed with extremely small channels. We would still need very long microtubules, however, as the microtubule would have to span the length of the channel…</p><br>

        <h4>But Where Is the Great White Tubule?</h4><br>
        <p><strong>But wait! Before you further...</strong></p><br>
        <p>You probably guessed where we're going with this...</p><br>
        <p>I mean, we did title the project after Moby-Dick...</p><br>
        <p>You're right! We wanted to make a procedure to develop <strong>long microtubules</strong>!</p><br>
        <p>Here's a short funny video laying out the groundworks of what we did!</p><br>

      <div class="docs-section" id="problem">
        <h4 class="docs-header">Well, It's a Problem Worth Solving...</h4>
        <p> As we stated before, microtubules serve as highways for kinesin molecules to shuttle cellular loads under in vitro conditions. In advancing the field of nanotechnology, this could be particularly useful as microtubules can be used as tracks for carrying molecular cargo within devices designed and specified at an extremely small scale. This would require us being capable of producing microtubules long enough to serve as these tracks; the microtubules would need to be long enough to span the length of a given channel and this may stretch to the scale of several hundred of microns. In order to achieve this goal, our team spent the past summer working on developing a procedure for consistently developing long microtubules in vitro.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="docs-section" id="approach">
        <h6 class="docs-header">It Always Starts With the Seeds!</h6>
        <p>Our first intuition in attempting to solve this problem came from a paper our principal investigator told us about in a lab meeting! In a paper co-authored between Henry Hess and Yolaine Jeune-Smith and published by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2010, we found literature indicating that the end to end annealing of microtubules could drive the average length of a given population of microtubules up if we were to initially shear them! The first phase in our experiments explored the role of shearing and annealing in developing longer tubules and whether this was a feasible solution to our problem!</p><br>
        <p>The second phase of our experiments explored the role of seeding and growing microtubules from seeds as a viable solution. This was based upon existing literature from Mitchison and Kirschner detailing a significant increase in average microtubule length when the tubules were grown from stabilized seeds. To understand seeding, let’s model the reaction rate of polymerization and the development of microtubules:</p><br>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
           <IMG src="images/konkoff.png" ALT="konkoff" align="center" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=260>
               </div>
        <div style="text-align: center;">

               </div>
        <p>From the equations above, we can see that increasing the average length depends upon:<br>(1) Increasing the total tubulin heterodimers in the system<br>(2) Decreasing the equilibrium constant or<br>(3) Reducing the number of nucleation sites.</p>
        <p>We tested for (1) and (3) by carrying out experiments involving continuous successive polymerization and seeding in the second phase of our experiments. </p><br>
        <p>Please review the appendices for the specific log of the lab notebook on each day of our testing!</p><br>

      <div class="docs-section" id="methods">
        <h4 class="docs-header">So What Did We DO Exactly?</h4>
        <p>The first nucleating agent we tested within our protocol was DMSO. The following protocol was employed:
  /n DMSO 
  /n (1)	A growth buffer(GBD) was prepared from -.
  /n (2)	One aliquot of lyophilized bovine tubulin purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Product code: - ) was reconstituted with the polymerization buffer. 8 uL of the buffer was used for a single aliquot.
  /n (3)	This aliquot was then incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes.
  /n (4)	The microtubule solution was diluted 100x and stabilized with – and – in order to create a solution to be referred to as MT100.
  /n (5)	A squash was prepared from this MT100 solution and imaged by a – objective within a fluorescent microscope (Model number and mode to be included) in order to see whether or not seeds were present. 
  /n (6)	Another aliquot of tubulin was reconstituted with 13.33 uL of the polymerization buffer and incubated on ice for 5 minutes.
  /n (7)	1.33 uL of the seed solution from before was added to this aliquot and the total solution was incubated for 30 minutes at 37 degrees Celsius. 
  /n (8)	An MT100 solution of this second aliquot was prepared as before with – and -. 
  /n (9)	A squash was obtained from the second aliquot and imaged with the fluorescent microscope in order to see if stable microtubules had grown. A squash was obtained from the pre-existing MT100 solution of the seeds to see if the seeds remained stable over time. 
  /n [Discussion of DMSO protocol]
  /n [ >> Shift to serially diluting seeds vs adding seeds to free tubulin]
  /n
  /n After modifying the protocol from adding the seeds to the free tubulin toward adding free tubulin to the seeds grown, the following protocol was employed in testing glycerol as a nucleating agent.
  /n
  /n Glycerol
  /n (1)	A growth buffer (GBgy) was prepared from –.
  /n (2)	One aliquot of lyophilized bovine tubulin purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Product code: - ) was reconstituted with the polymerization buffer. 6.25 uL of the buffer was used for a single aliquot.
  /n (3)	This aliquot was then incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 45 minutes.
  /n (4)	The microtubule solution was diluted 100x and stabilized with – and – in order to create a solution to be referred to as MT100.
  /n (5)	A squash was prepared from this MT100 solution and imaged by a – objective within a fluorescent microscope (Model number and mode to be included) in order to see whether or not seeds were present. 
  /n (6)	Another aliquot of tubulin was reconstituted to 40 uM by adding the glycerol based growth buffer.
  /n (7)	3 uL of this second aliquot was then added to the seed solution, thereby producing 15 uM of free tubulin in 8 uL of solution.
  /n (8)	This was repolymerized for an hour at 37 degrees Celsius within the water bath. 
  /n (9)	An MT100 solution of this second aliquot was prepared as before with – and -. 
  /n (10)	A squash was obtained from the second aliquot and imaged with the fluorescent microscope in order to see if stable microtubules had grown. A squash was obtained from the pre-existing MT100 solution of the seeds to see if the seeds remained stable over time. 
  /n 
  /n Finally, for the GMPCPP based protocol, the final concentrations of tubulin employed were shifted according the Howard and Kirschner from - . The final protocol under which GMPCCP was tested was: - 
  /n 
  /n GMPCPP
  /n (1)	A growth buffer (GBGMP) was prepared from -1 uL of 10 mM GMPCPP and 24 uL of BRB80. Initially believed stock was 25 mM and believed resultant conc. was 1 mM GMPCPP. Actually produced 0.4 mM GMPCPP.
  /n (2)	Add 10 uL of GBn to tubulin to prepare 20 uM seeds.
  /n (3)	Incubate on ice for 5 mins.
  /n (4)	Incubate in water bath of 1 hr. at 37 degrees.
  /n (5)	Extract and image seeds in a prepped MT100 seeds solution to check they have been created. 
  /n (6)	Prepared GBx (Growth buffer for second round of GTP driven poly of seeds)
  /n (7)	2.5 uL of seeds, 2.5 uL of MG, 1 uL of GTP and 19 uL of BRB80, giving 10x dilution of seeds. In this initial attempt the seeds were added to more tubulin.
  /n (8)	10 uL of this GBx solution added to tubulin
  /n (9)	Incubate for 1 hr. Imaged.</p>
