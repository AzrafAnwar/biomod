         <h4 class="docs-header">Introduction - So What's the Scoop on Microtubules?</h4>
                  <div class="row">
           <p>Microtubules are polymers found within our cells that serve as components of the intracellular cytoskeleton. They are filamentous polymers composed of subunits known as tubulin heterodimers and are involved in a variety of intracellular functions ranging from cell division to intracellular transport.<br><br>vivo conditions, tubulin heterodimers are formed from α- and β-tubulin molecules spontaneously binding together. These heterodimers are organized into functional microtubules within the cell through nucleation and polymerization. Microtubule organizing centers, or MTOCs, contain another type of tubulin known as γ-tubulin. They form zones within the cell from which microtubules can grow by forming protofilaments which can then combine to form microtubules. The energy for these heterodimers binding onto one another is provided through the hydrolysis of guanosine tri-phosphate (GTP) to guanosine di-phospate (GDP).</p><br>

           <h6 align="center">Polymers of Heterodimers<sup>Image Source:<a href="https://biomod2016.gitlab.io/columbia/#references">[4]</a></sup></h6>
           <br><p>In vitro conditions, an adequate supply of GTP leads to nucleation and subsequent polymerization occuring spontaneously; however, kinetic barriers involved in the reaction process maintains a low rate of polymerization. Nucleating agents, such as di-methyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or glycerol, help overcome these barriers.<br><br>During equilibrium, in both in vitro and in vivo, microtubules possess a property known as dynamic instability; they shift between growing and shrinking phases. Microtubules are also capable of combining front-to-end if they are capable of meeting within the solution they are present in. These characteristics allow for several interesting interactions within populations of microtubules and free tubulin heterodimers, including length redistribution, seed growth and annealing. </p><br>

           <br><p>These are interactions that would allow us to grow LONGER microtubules if manipulated correctly. But why are we interested in longer microtubules? We stated before that microtubules form a part of the intracellular cytoskeleton. More specifically, they form a network of tubules that span the cell and provide it structural stability. This network also serves as a highway through which cellular loads can be shuttled around the cell by travelling along the length of the microtubule.<br><br>It achieves this transport by working in tandem with kinesin, a motor protein capable of attaching itself onto a target molecule. Once bound on to a microtubule, kinesin can take “steps” along the length of the microtubule by hydrolyzing adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP). Any payload bound to the kinesin is carried along as well!</p><br>

           <br><p>This particular property could prove to be extremely useful when engineering on the nanoscale. Microtubules could potentially provide a highway for shuttling molecular cargo within devices. This would require very long microtubules that would span the size of the device.</p><br>

        <h4>Project Video - But Where Is the Great White Tubule?</h4><br>
        <p><strong>But wait! Before you further...</strong><br><br>
        You probably guessed where we're going with this...<br><br>
        I mean, we did title the project after Moby-Dick...<br><br>
        You're right! We wanted to make a procedure to develop <strong>long microtubules</strong>!<br><br>
        Here's a short funny video laying out the groundworks of what we did!</p><br>

      <div class="docs-section" id="problem">
        <h4 class="docs-header">Well, It's a Problem Worth Solving...</h4>
        <p> As we stated before, microtubules serve as highways for kinesin molecules to shuttle cellular loads under in vitro conditions. In advancing the field of nanotechnology, this could be particularly useful as microtubules can be used as tracks for carrying molecular cargo within devices designed and specified at an extremely small scale. This would require us being capable of producing microtubules long enough to serve as these tracks; the microtubules would need to be long enough to span the length of a given channel and this may stretch to the scale of several hundred of microns. In order to achieve this goal, our team spent the past summer working on developing a procedure for consistently developing long microtubules in vitro.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="docs-section" id="approach">
        <h6 class="docs-header">Approach - It Always Starts With the Seeds!</h6>
        <p>Our first intuition in attempting to solve this problem came from a paper our principal investigator told us about in a lab meeting! A paper co-authored between Henry Hess and Yolaine Jeune-Smith and published by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2010 claimed that shearing could drive the annealing of microtubules, leading to longer microtubules! The first phase in our experiments explored the role of shearing and annealing in developing longer tubules and whether this was a feasible solution to our problem!<br><br>
        The second phase of our experiments explored the role of seeding and growing microtubules from seeds as a viable solution. This was based upon work done by Mitchison and Kirschner, which described a significant increase in average microtubule length when the tubules were grown from stabilized seeds.<a href="https://biomod2016.gitlab.io/columbia/#references"><sup>[2]</sup></a><a href="https://biomod2016.gitlab.io/columbia/#references"><sup>[3]</sup></a><a href="https://biomod2016.gitlab.io/columbia/#references"><sup>[6]</sup></a><br><br> To understand seeding, let’s model the dynamics of microtubule polymerization:</p><br>

           <strong>T<sub>F</sub> at Equilibrium = T<sub>eq</sub> = k<sub>on</sub>/k<sub>off</sub> [From solving Equation 1 when dT<sub>p</sub>/dt = 0 at Equilibrium]</strong><br>

           <strong>where,<br> T<sub>p</sub> = Number of Tubulin dimers in polymerized microtubules<br>
           T<sub>F</sub> = Number of Free Tubulin dimers in the system<br>

               </div>
        <p> In the above equations, L is taken to be a measure of the average length of the microtubules prepared by the system. This is because the number of tubulin dimers associated with the microtubule is responsible for the length observed.<a href="https://biomod2016.gitlab.io/columbia/#references"><sup>[6]</sup></a><br><br>
        From the equations above, we can see that increasing the average length depends upon:<br>(1) Reducing the number of nucleation sites.<br>(2) Decreasing the equilibrium constant or<br>(3) Increasing the total tubulin heterodimers in the system<br><br>
        We tested for (1) and (3) by carrying out experiments involving continuous successive polymerization and seeding in the second phase of our experiments. Method (2) was factored into our experiments when comparing the efficacy of the various types of tagged tubulin used. <br><br>

        <h4 class="docs-header">Methods - So What Did We DO Exactly?</h4>
        <h6>Shearing and Annealing</h6>
        <p>A standard polymerization buffer was first prepared by combining stock solutions of standard Brinkley Resuspension Buffer with 80mM PIPES solution (BRB80 buffer), 100 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> solution, 4 mg/mL GTP solution and 5% DMSO solution to produce final concentrations of 4 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 0.16 mg/mL of GTP and 0.0024% of DMSO.<br><br>
        6.25 µL of this polymerization buffer was then added to an aliquot of tubulin to produce a final tubulin concentration of 3.2 mg/mL within the solution. This solution was then incubated in a water bath for 30 minutes at 37 ͦC.<br><br>
        At the end of this incubation period, the microtubule solution was stabilized by adding paclitaxel and more BRB80; they were then sheared by passing through a 25-gauge needle over a 10 second period. The sheared microtubules were then replaced within the water bath to allow annealing to take place. These were then imaged.<a href="https://biomod2016.gitlab.io/columbia/#references"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p><br>
        <h6>Seeding</h6>
        <p>Several nucleating agents were used in these experiments to test their efficacy in forming stabilized microtubule seeds. Please note that what follows is a general outline of the procedures utilized in the seeding experiment as the exact nucleating agent used, as well as the volumes and concentrations of specific reagents, were modified to produce the largest microtubule possible.<br><br>
        In general, as before, a standard polymerization buffer was first prepared by combining stock solutions of standard BRB80 buffer, 100 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> solution, 4 mg/mL GTP solution and 5% DMSO solution to produce final concentrations of 4 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 0.16 mg/mL of GTP and 0.0024% of DMSO.<a href="https://biomod2016.gitlab.io/columbia/#references"><sup>[3]</sup></a><br><br>
        6.25 µL of this polymerization buffer was then added to an aliquot of tubulin to produce a final tubulin concentration of 3.2 mg/mL within the solution. This solution was then incubated in a water bath for 30 minutes at 37  ͦC.<a href="https://biomod2016.gitlab.io/columbia/#references"><sup>[3]</sup></a><br><br>
        These microtubules were then stabilized by adding paclitaxel and more BRB80. The stabilized microtubules were then imaged to see whether microtubules viable to serve as seeds were present. When stable candidates were observed, another aliquot of microtubules were reconstituted by using the same polymerization buffer WITHOUT any nucleating agent i.e. no DMSO, glycerol or guanosine-5’-[(α,β)-methyleno]triphosphate (GMPCPP).  This aliquot was then combined with the seeds prepared from before and replaced within the water bath to incubate for at least 30 minutes before imaging.</p><br>
        <h6>On Imaging</h6>
        <p>Please note that all imaging in both sets of procedures took place using a Nikon TE2000 epifluorescence microscope equipped with an EXFO X-cite 120 lamp (EXFO, Ontario, Canada) and an Andor Technology iXON DU1857 and Zyla camera. The tubulin aliquots utilized were purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. and were tagged with rhodamine and/or hilyte GFP Fluor 488.</p><br>
        <h6>Simulations</h6>
        <p>In addition to experiments, we developed a simulation in Python to model the growth of many microtubules within a small volume of solution. We used a stochastic simulation algorithm. There is a certain random timestep between reactions, and that timestep follows an exponential distribution. Either a polymerization or a depolymerization reaction occurs after each timestep, and the probability of either one occurring is determined by the propensity of each reaction, which is roughly equivalent to the reaction rate. These simulations were then compared to the behavior of microtubule growth found from the experiments in order to glean a future direction of experimentation to be taken.</p>

         <p>GMPCPP seeds were stable but did not form seeds longer then the average of the regular motility assay protcol. Seeds with glycerol were successful in producing longer microtubules. In fact, the largest microtubule we found all summer, measured at 144 µm, was found from a glycerol seeding experiment. The averages for these tubules were found to be approximately between 34 to 36 µm, which was higher than microtubules grown from a normal motility assay protocol, which were found to range between 18 to 20 µm.</p>

        <h6>Annealing requires time! (Or a lot of tubules!)</h6>
          <p>As we stated earlier, the first phase of experimenting was inspired by a paper written by Professor Hess and Dr. Jeune – Smith, first published in 2010, in which they explored the process of shearing and annealing microtubules. <br>
         Shearing refers to the process by which polymerized microtubules were broken down by exposing them to a shear force; this results in a cleavage of the microtubule as a result of the high mechanical force they are exposed to. Conversely, annealing refers to a process by which smaller microtubules join to form a longer whole; this involves them joining end-to-end, which means that the process is heavily dependent on the length and concentration of the microtubules present within a given population.<a href="https://biomod2016.gitlab.io/columbia/#references"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The effects of these processes in controlling the length distribution of a given population of microtubules are highlighted below: <br></p>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
           <IMG src="images/annealing.PNG" ALT="konkoff" align="center" WIDTH=374 HEIGHT=689><p><br><h6 align="center">Effects of Shearing and Annealing on Microtubule Population<sup>Image Source:<a href="https://biomod2016.gitlab.io/columbia/#references">[1]</a></sup></h6><br>
               </div>
         <p>The microtubules that we grew from our annealing experiments did not demonstrate the expected level of growth highlighted in the literature utilized. We expect that this is due to the concentration dependence of the annealing process; due to limitations in stocks of tubulin aliquots, the experimental concentration of tubulin utilized was below the volume-concentration of tubulin used within the literature we referred to.</p>
         <h6>Seeds seem to work!</h6>
         <p>Although annealing by itself did not, the microtubules grown from our glycerol seeds seem to have been extremely successful in growing. In order to test this, we imaged microtubules grown from free tubulin and seeds prepared with different fluorophores. When the resultant microtubules were imaged, we found that two separate, and distinct fluorescence patterns were observed pertaining to the area of the seeds and to the area of tubulin attached on to the existing seeds. Due to overlaps in the excitation spectrum of hilyte and rhodamine, both fluorescent molecules could be imaged with the Zyla Rhod and DU817 488 setting on the microscope to differing levels of fluorescence. The bright dots within the tubules are the seeds prepared when they were imaged with Zyla Rhod, since the seeds were prepared from rhodamine tagged tubulin.</p>
         <p>Seeding experiments carried out from GMPCPP produced stable seeds but these seeds did not polymerize successfully. Clusters of tubules were found to form from our seeding protocol with GMPCPP when imaged under the microscope; all microtubules observed were found to be smaller than the normal motility assay protocol. 
         Seeding experiments carried out with glycerol as the nucleating agent were largely successful in producing microtubules polymerized from the seeds. In fact, the largest microtubule we found all summer, measured at 144 µm, was found from a glycerol seeding experiment.</p>
         <h6>Once more, with simulations.</h6>
         <p>With this simulation, we were able to plot the lengths of individual microtubules over time, shown in Image 7. This demonstrates that some microtubules grow longer than others due to the randomness in the polymerization/depolymerization processes. We also constructed a kymograph to visualize a single microtubule growing over time, shown in Image 8. Growth from the positive end of the microtubule is more rapid than growth from the minus end.<br><br>
         We also observed how the distribution of lengths across the microtubule population changed with time by plotting a histogram of lengths at different time points throughout the simulation. Histograms of 100 microtubules for 5 different time points are shown in Image 9, as well as the average and standard deviation of the population over time. Early in the polymerization process, the mean length increases over time. Eventually the mean reaches a steady state, but the distribution continues to change shape after that point and the standard deviation increases. This represents a “dynamic equilibrium” in which tubulin continues to redistribute between different microtubules even after the total amount of polymerized tubulin has reached a steady state. Thus, the simulation allows us to examine the dynamics of individual microtubules, which provides information that we can’t get from just observing the population average.<br><br>
         Our mathematical model consists of 3 tunable parameters: the number of nucleation sites (M), the tubulin equilibrium constant (Teq), and the total tubulin concentration (Ttotal). We were also able to manipulate these parameters both experimentally (see experimental results section) and within the simulation (Image 10). The simulated data matches our mathematical model and the experimental results. Specifically, we were able to produce overall longer microtubules in the simulated populations by decreasing the number of nucleation sites, decreasing Teq, and increasing Ttotal. <br><br>
         The mathematical model and simulated data allow us to determine in more detail how the population changes with each parameter change. Note, for example, that average length increases linearly with Ttotal, while average length does not increase linearly with the other two parameters. The average length increases as the number of nucleation sites(M) and free tubulin at equilibrium(T<sub>eq</sub>) decreases. This information could help us in designing future experiments to further increase microtubule length.</p>
