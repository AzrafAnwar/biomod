         <h4 class="docs-header">So What's the Scoop on Microtubules?</h4>
                  <div class="row">
           <p>Microtubules are proteins found within our cells that serve as a component of the intracellular cytoskeleton. They are filamentous polymer proteins composed of subunits known as tubulin heterodimers and are involved in a variety of intracellular functions ranging from cell division to intracellular transport.<br><br>Under in vivo conditions, tubulin heterodimers are formed from α- and β-tubulin molecules spontaneously binding together. These heterodimers are organized into functional microtubules within the cell through nucleation and polymerization. Microtubule organizing centers, or MTOCs, containing another type of tubulin known as γ-tubulin, form zones within the cell from which microtubules can grow by forming protofilaments which can then combine to form microtubules. The energy for these heterodimers binding on to one another is provided through through the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP present within the structure of the heterodimers and cell cytoplasm.</p><br>

           <h6 align="center">Polymers of Heterodimers<sup>Image Source:<a href="https://biomod2016.gitlab.io/columbia/#references">[4]</a></sup></h6>
           <br><p>Under in vitro conditions, nucleation and subsequent polymerization occurs spontaneously assuming an adequate supply of GTP is present; however, kinetic barriers involved in the reaction process maintains a low rate of microtubule assembly in vitro unless other nucleating agents such as DMSO or glycerol are present.<br><br>During steady state conditions in both in vitro and in vivo, microtubules possess a property known as dynamic instability in which a single microtubule shifts between a growing and hrinking phase. Microtubules are also capable of combining end on end if their ends are capable of meeting within the solution they are present in. These characteristics mean that populations of microtubules will generally contain some microtubules that are growing and some that are shrinking; this allows for several interesting interactions within populations of microtubules and free tubulin heterodimers, including length redistribution, seed growth and annealing. </p><br>

           <br><p>These are interactions that would allow us to grow LONGER microtubules if manipulated correctly. But why are we interested in longer microtubules? We stated before that microtubules form a part of the intracellular cytoskeleton. More specifically, they form a network of tubules that span the cell and provide it structural stability. This network also serves a highway through which cellular loads can be shuttled around the cell by travelling along the length of the microtubule.<br><br>It achieves this by working in tandem with kinesin, a motor protein capable of attaching itself onto a target molecule. Once bounded on to a microtubule’s surface, kinesin can take “steps” along the length of the microtubule by hydrolyzing ATP. If a load is bound to the kinesin molecule, this load molecule is carried along with the kinesin as well!</p><br>

           <br><p>This particular property could be prove to extremely useful when engineering in the nano and micro scales. As microtubules can be used as tracks for carrying molecular cargo, they could potentially provide a highway for shuttling cargo within devices designed with extremely small channels. We would still need very long microtubules, however, as the microtubule would have to span the length of the channel…</p><br>

        <h4>But Where Is the Great White Tubule?</h4><br>
        <p><strong>But wait! Before you further...</strong><br><br>
        You probably guessed where we're going with this...<br><br>
        I mean, we did title the project after Moby-Dick...<br><br>
        You're right! We wanted to make a procedure to develop <strong>long microtubules</strong>!<br><br>
        Here's a short funny video laying out the groundworks of what we did!</p><br>

      <div class="docs-section" id="problem">
        <h4 class="docs-header">Well, It's a Problem Worth Solving...</h4>
        <p> As we stated before, microtubules serve as highways for kinesin molecules to shuttle cellular loads under in vitro conditions. In advancing the field of nanotechnology, this could be particularly useful as microtubules can be used as tracks for carrying molecular cargo within devices designed and specified at an extremely small scale. This would require us being capable of producing microtubules long enough to serve as these tracks; the microtubules would need to be long enough to span the length of a given channel and this may stretch to the scale of several hundred of microns. In order to achieve this goal, our team spent the past summer working on developing a procedure for consistently developing long microtubules in vitro.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="docs-section" id="approach">
        <h6 class="docs-header">It Always Starts With the Seeds!</h6>
        <p>Our first intuition in attempting to solve this problem came from a paper our principal investigator told us about in a lab meeting! In a paper co-authored between Henry Hess and Yolaine Jeune-Smith and published by the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2010, we found literature indicating that the end to end annealing of microtubules could drive the average length of a given population of microtubules up if we were to initially shear them! The first phase in our experiments explored the role of shearing and annealing in developing longer tubules and whether this was a feasible solution to our problem!<br><br>
        The second phase of our experiments explored the role of seeding and growing microtubules from seeds as a viable solution. This was based upon existing literature from Mitchison and Kirschner detailing a significant increase in average microtubule length when the tubules were grown from stabilized seeds.<a href="https://biomod2016.gitlab.io/columbia/#references"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.<a href="https://biomod2016.gitlab.io/columbia/#references"><sup>[3]</sup></a><br><br> To understand seeding, let’s model the reaction rate of polymerization and the development of microtubules:</p><br>

           <p><strong>dT<sub>p</sub> = k<sub>on</sub>T<sub>F</sub>M - k<sub>off</sub>M</strong><br>
           <strong>T<sub>F</sub> + M &harr; T<sub>p</sub></strong><br>
           <strong>T<sub>p</sub> = T<sub>Total</sub> - k<sub>eq</sub></strong><br>
           <strong>k<sub>eq</sub> = k<sub>on</sub>/k<sub>off</sub></strong><br>
           <strong>L = T<sub>p</sub>/M = (T<sub>Total</sub> - k<sub>eq</sub>)/M</strong><br>
           <strong>where,<br> T<sub>p</sub> = Number of Tubulin dimers in polymerized microtubules<br>
           T<sub>F</sub> = Number of Free Tubulin dimers in the system<br>
           T<sub>Total</sub> = Total Number of Free Tubulin dimers in the system<br>
           M = Number of Nucleation Sites<br>
           k<sub>off/on</sub> = Rate Constants for Polymerization/Depolymerization from Microtubules<br>
           k<sub>eq</sub> = Equilibrium Constant<br>
           L = Average Number of Tubulin Dimers per Microtubule</strong></p>
           
               </div>
        <p> In the above equations, L is taken to be a measure of the average length of the microtubules within the population prepared by the system as the number of tubulin dimers associated with the microtubule polymer is responsible for the length observed.<br><br>
        From the equations above, we can see that increasing the average length depends upon:<br>(1) Increasing the total tubulin heterodimers in the system<br>(2) Decreasing the equilibrium constant or<br>(3) Reducing the number of nucleation sites.<br><br>
        We tested for (1) and (3) by carrying out experiments involving continuous successive polymerization and seeding in the second phase of our experiments. <br><br>

        <h4 class="docs-header">So What Did We DO Exactly?</h4>
        <h6>Shearing and Annealing</h6>
        <p>A standard polymerization buffer was first prepared by combining stock solutions of standard BRB80 buffer, 100 mM Mg+ solution, 4 mg/mL GTP solution and 5% DMSO solution to produce final concentrations of 4 mM Mg+, 0.16 mg/mL of GTP and 0.0024% of DMSO.<br><br>
        6.25 µL of this polymerization buffer was then added to an aliquot of tubulin to produce a final tubulin concentration of 3.2 mg/mL within the solution. This solution was then incubated in a water bath for 30 minutes at 37 ͦC.<br><br>
        At the end of this incubation period, the microtubule solution was stabilized by adding paclitaxel and more BRB80; they were then sheared by passing through a 25-gauge needle over a 10 second period. The sheared microtubules were then replaced within the water bath to allow annealing to take place. These were then imaged.</p><br>
        <h6>Seeding</h6>
        <p>Several nucleating agents were used in these experiments to test their efficacy in forming stabilized microtubule seeds. Please note that what follows is a general outline of the procedures utilized in the seeding experiment as the exact nucleating agent used, as well as the volumes and concentrations of specific reagents, were modified to produce the largest microtubule possible.<br><br>
        In general, as before, a standard polymerization buffer was first prepared by combining stock solutions of standard BRB80 buffer, 100 mM Mg+ solution, 4 mg/mL GTP solution and 5% DMSO solution to produce final concentrations of 4 mM Mg+, 0.16 mg/mL of GTP and 0.0024% of DMSO.<br><br>
        6.25 µL of this polymerization buffer was then added to an aliquot of tubulin to produce a final tubulin concentration of 3.2 mg/mL within the solution. This solution was then incubated in a water bath for 30 minutes at 37  ͦC.<br><br>
        These microtubules were then stabilized by adding paclitaxel and more BRB80. The stabilized microtubules were then imaged to see whether microtubules viable to serve as seeds were present. When stable candidates were observed, another aliquot of microtubules were reconstituted by using the same polymerization buffer WITHOUT any nucleating agent i.e. no DMSO, glycerol or GMPCPP.  This aliquot was then combined with the seeds prepared from before and replaced within the water bath to incubate for at least 30 minutes before imaging.</p><br>
        <h6>On Imaging</h6>
        <p>Please note that all imaging in both sets of procedures took place using a Nikon TE2000 epifluorescence microscope equipped with an EXFO X-cite 120 lamp (EXFO, Ontario, Canada) and an Andor Technology iXON DU885LC EMCCD camera. The tubulin aliquots utilized were purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. and were tagged with rhodamine and/or hilyte GFP Fluor 488.</p><br>

      <div class="docs-section" id="results">
        <h4 class="docs-header">Well, What Does This All Mean?</h4>
        <h6>Annealing</h6>
          <p>As we stated earlier, the first phase of experimenting was inspired by a paper written by Professor Hess and Dr. Jeune – Smith, first published in 2010, in which they explored the process of shearing and annealing microtubules. <br>
         Shearing refers to the process by which polymerized microtubules were broken down by exposing them to a shear force; this results in a cleavage of the microtubule polymer as a result of the high mechanical force they are exposed to. Conversely, annealing refers to a process by which smaller microtubule polymers join to form a longer whole; this involves them joining end-to-end, which means that the process is heavily dependent on the length and concentration of the microtubules present within a given population.<a href="https://biomod2016.gitlab.io/columbia/#references"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
