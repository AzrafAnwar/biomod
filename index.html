            <p>Microtubules are cytoskeletal proteins used by our cells in shuttling various molecules throughout its cytoplasm. It achieves this by working in tandem with kinesin, a motor protein capable of attaching itself onto a target molecule and thereby drag it along a microtubules length. In advancing the field of nanotechnology, this could be particularly useful as microtubules can be used as tracks for carrying molecular cargo. This would require us being capable of producing microtubules long enough to serve as these tracks; the microtubules would need to be long enough to span the length of a given channel and this may stretch to the scale of several hundred of microns. In order to achieve this goal, our team spent the past summer working on developing a procedure for consistently developing long microtubules in vitro. /n To this end, we developed our procedure by basing it off of preexisting literature supporting the development of microtubules from “seeds” or tubulin that has been pre-nucleated in order to provide centers for microtubule growth. We believed that this would produce longer microtubules as the tubulin monomers present within the solution would bind on to these seeds in the absence of a nucleating agent, thereby creating a smaller number of longer microtubules.</p>

        <h6 class="docs-header">Approach</h6>
        <p>We began developing our procedure by basing it off of pre-existing literature on microtubule seeding. In particular, following the example of Mitchison and Kirschner from their 1984 article, Dynamic Instability of Microtubule Growth, we believed that developing microtubules from pre-existing seeds would restrict sites of nucleation and growth to the seeds, thereby increasing the amount of free tubulin heterodimers binding on to the same microtubules. 	
  	/n Our seeding protocol centered on the use of several different types of primary nucleating agents in growing stable seeds from which microtubules could be grown. In particular, the nucleating agents tested in the process of producing stable seeds were dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), glycerol and  guanylyl-(alpha, beta)-methylene-diphosphonate (GMPCPP). In this preliminary stage of establishing a working nucleating agent for our protocol, the methods tested in developing the seeds followed the protocols provided below.</p>
      </div>
  
      <div class="docs-section" id="methods">
        <h4 class="docs-header">Methods</h4>
        <p>The first nucleating agent we tested within our protocol was DMSO. The following protocol was employed:
  /n DMSO 
  /n (1)	A growth buffer(GBD) was prepared from -.
  /n (2)	One aliquot of lyophilized bovine tubulin purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Product code: - ) was reconstituted with the polymerization buffer. 8 uL of the buffer was used for a single aliquot.
  /n (3)	This aliquot was then incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes.
  /n (4)	The microtubule solution was diluted 100x and stabilized with – and – in order to create a solution to be referred to as MT100.
  /n (5)	A squash was prepared from this MT100 solution and imaged by a – objective within a fluorescent microscope (Model number and mode to be included) in order to see whether or not seeds were present. 
  /n (6)	Another aliquot of tubulin was reconstituted with 13.33 uL of the polymerization buffer and incubated on ice for 5 minutes.
  /n (7)	1.33 uL of the seed solution from before was added to this aliquot and the total solution was incubated for 30 minutes at 37 degrees Celsius. 
  /n (8)	An MT100 solution of this second aliquot was prepared as before with – and -. 
  /n (9)	A squash was obtained from the second aliquot and imaged with the fluorescent microscope in order to see if stable microtubules had grown. A squash was obtained from the pre-existing MT100 solution of the seeds to see if the seeds remained stable over time. 
  /n [Discussion of DMSO protocol]
  /n [ >> Shift to serially diluting seeds vs adding seeds to free tubulin]
  /n
  /n After modifying the protocol from adding the seeds to the free tubulin toward adding free tubulin to the seeds grown, the following protocol was employed in testing glycerol as a nucleating agent.
  /n
  /n Glycerol
  /n (1)	A growth buffer (GBgy) was prepared from –.
  /n (2)	One aliquot of lyophilized bovine tubulin purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Product code: - ) was reconstituted with the polymerization buffer. 6.25 uL of the buffer was used for a single aliquot.
  /n (3)	This aliquot was then incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 45 minutes.
  /n (4)	The microtubule solution was diluted 100x and stabilized with – and – in order to create a solution to be referred to as MT100.
  /n (5)	A squash was prepared from this MT100 solution and imaged by a – objective within a fluorescent microscope (Model number and mode to be included) in order to see whether or not seeds were present. 
  /n (6)	Another aliquot of tubulin was reconstituted to 40 uM by adding the glycerol based growth buffer.
  /n (7)	3 uL of this second aliquot was then added to the seed solution, thereby producing 15 uM of free tubulin in 8 uL of solution.
  /n (8)	This was repolymerized for an hour at 37 degrees Celsius within the water bath. 
  /n (9)	An MT100 solution of this second aliquot was prepared as before with – and -. 
  /n (10)	A squash was obtained from the second aliquot and imaged with the fluorescent microscope in order to see if stable microtubules had grown. A squash was obtained from the pre-existing MT100 solution of the seeds to see if the seeds remained stable over time. 
  /n 
  /n Finally, for the GMPCPP based protocol, the final concentrations of tubulin employed were shifted according the Howard and Kirschner from - . The final protocol under which GMPCCP was tested was: - 
  /n 
  /n GMPCPP
  /n (1)	A growth buffer (GBGMP) was prepared from -1 uL of 10 mM GMPCPP and 24 uL of BRB80. Initially believed stock was 25 mM and believed resultant conc. was 1 mM GMPCPP. Actually produced 0.4 mM GMPCPP.
  /n (2)	Add 10 uL of GBn to tubulin to prepare 20 uM seeds.
  /n (3)	Incubate on ice for 5 mins.
  /n (4)	Incubate in water bath of 1 hr. at 37 degrees.
  /n (5)	Extract and image seeds in a prepped MT100 seeds solution to check they have been created. 
  /n (6)	Prepared GBx (Growth buffer for second round of GTP driven poly of seeds)
  /n (7)	2.5 uL of seeds, 2.5 uL of MG, 1 uL of GTP and 19 uL of BRB80, giving 10x dilution of seeds. In this initial attempt the seeds were added to more tubulin.
  /n (8)	10 uL of this GBx solution added to tubulin
  /n (9)	Incubate for 1 hr. Imaged.</p>
