           <p>7-20
<br>polymerized tubulin and made mt100
<br>sheared the mt 100 solution using Hess/Jeune-Smith protocol. 250 uL of mt100 was passed through a 25 gauge needle with 1 mL syringe 5 times.
<br>we imaged both sheared and unsheared microtubules under the microscope. There was no considerable difference between sheared and unsheared microtubule lengths.

<br><br>7-21
<br>  microtubules sheared 7-20 were sheared again. They appeared fragmented when imaged.
<br>these sheared microtubules were placed into a  37℃ water bath for 90 minutes.
<br>both sheared and unsheared microtubules were diluted by 5 and the squashes were imaged. 
<br>We also imaged microtubules left to anneal in the water bath. These microtubules did appear to grow.

<br>Seeding experiment<br> we took unsheared mt100 and sheared them using the same procedure. Polymerized 2 aliquots of tubulin with the seeds. Aliquot 1 <br> 12.5 uL mT100(sheared seeds), 1uL GTP, 1 uL Mg, 1.2 DMSO, 9.3 uL BRB80. Aliquot2 <br>  12.5 uL MT100(sheared seeds), 1uL GTP, 1 uL Mg, and 10.5 BRB80. Both aliquots were left to polymerize for 90 min.
 <br> After analyzing the data the unsheared microtubules had an average length of 13um, sheared twice 6um, seeded without dmso 9um, seeded with dmso 17um. 


<br><br>7-25
<br>We attempted to replicate the seeding experiment protocol outlined in the Mitchison and Kirschner paper on dynamic instability of microtubule growth(1984) with the hope that we may be able to repeat their results and increase average microtubule length to 30-40um.
<br>Seeding Experiment #2 <br> 1)  we polymerized tubulin using standard polimerization buffer, 8 ul for 1 aliquot of tubulin(final tubulin concentration of 25uM) at 37℃ for 30 min. <br> 2) We then imaged a squash of the mt100 to see if the tubules had grown. <br> 3) We used another aliquot of tubulin, this time with 13.33 ul polymerization buffer and no DMSO(just Mg,and GTP in BRB80), added buffer then incubated in ice for 5 min, then added 1.33 ul of seeds from the 25 ul polymerized earlier.(final tubulin 15 uM in solution), then set in 37℃ water bath for 30 min.

<br>After analyzing the images using Fiesta the average mt100 lengths before seeding were 11.56 um and 10.54 um(taken from 2 images of the same solution). The mt100 lengths after seeding were 9.097 um and 9.326 um. In trying to replicate the results of this experiment, our resulting microtubules were on average 1um shorter. We were expecting to achieve a growth of up to 30-40um. 
<br>In the original protocol from the Kirshner paper glycerol was added to the polymerization buffer. Adding glycerol may yield desired growth.

<br><br>7-27
<br>Repeated seeding experiment from 7-25 with a few changes. We used a mixture of hylite and rhodamine labeled tubulin. Microtubules seeds were made from hylite tubulin and added to rhodamine tubulin. We suspected that if the rhodamine grows using the hylite seeds, we will be able to directly measure its effectiveness by using different laser frequencies from the microscope.
<br>seeds were produced at 32 uM tubulin (6.25 Growth Buffer) for first polymerization, diluted to 15 uM for second polymerization. Allowed first polymerization to run at 37℃ for 30 min, second for 1 hour
<br>squash of hylite seeds showed long MTs.
<br>squash of hylite seeds and Rhodamine tubulin post<br>seeding showed only rhodamine microtubules<br>no hylite seeds visible under 647 Tirf
<br>Hylite seeds may break down naturally over time, also possible that immersing in ice caused breakdown

<br><br>7-28
<br>repeated same seeding procedure mentioned 7/27/16 with a few changes<br>
1.	In order to more closely replicate the Mitchison paper, we pre-warmed the tubulin before adding the seeds<br>
2.	This time the seeds were made with rhodamine tubulin and were added to hylite tubulin. Rhodamine tubulin was polymerized in 6.25 uL growth buffer for 30 min. After polymerization 6uL of taxol was added. 1.33 uL rhodamine seeds were added to 13.33uL growth buffer and hylite tubulin polymerized at 37℃ for 30 min

<br>when we viewed our seeds, we noticed that they were mostly broken down and shorter than before.(It is possible that hylite polymerizes better)
<br>We could not observe rhodamine tubulin attached to hylite tubulin
<br>In order to more closely recreate the original paper we will add glycerol to the growing seeds

<br>polymerized for 45 min at 37℃
<br>imaging mt100 showed concentrated very short microtubules or free tubulin.
<br> we added 3uL of 40 uM tubulin to original polymerization solution. The 3uL contained standard growth buffer with no DMSO. final tubulin was 15 uM in 8 uL. Polymerized for 1 hour at 37℃.
<br>imaged again, this time the microtubules were much longer.
<br>Diluted 0.5 uL of these seeds into 15uM(in 5 uL) tubulin with standard growth buffer(without dmso), polymerized for 45 min at 37℃.
<br>After imaging, seeds diluted in 15 uM did not seem to grow longer.
<br>imaged non<br> diluted and diluted seeds after another hour. Diluted seeds looked much longer. Non<br>diluted hadn’t grown.

<br><br>8-2

<br>Split tubulin aliquot in 2. Half for making seeds, half to add later to the seeds.
<br>added 3.5 uL BRB80 to aliquot
<br>removed 1.75 uL to separate tube
<br>Made Growth Buffer with:
	<br>7.5 uL glycerol
	<br>2.5 uL Mg
	<br>1 uL GTP
<br>and added 1.375 uL to the tubulin aliquot. This was vortexed heavily, then polymerized for 30 min at 37℃. We began polymerizing at 11:26AM
<br>2nd growth buffer:
	<br>10.56uL BRB80

<br>We also imaged MT100 from diluted seeds made yesterday
<br>We added 3uL of BRB80 and 3 uL taxol (warmed to room temp) to diluted seeds, also kept MT100 from diluted seeds.

<br><br>8-3
<br>Imaged diluted seeds and seeds from 8<br>1 and 8<br>2
<br>Seeds from 8<br>2 that had taxol directly added to polymerization mix broke down.
<br>seeds from 8<br>1 grew longer<br> possibly longer than diluted

<br><br>8-4
<br>Imaged seeds and diluted seeds from 8<br>1 and 8<br>2
<br>tried to re<br>polymerize seeds from 8<br>1 (MT100):
	<br>5 uL growth buffer in 1 tubulin aliqout (standard gb w/o dmso, 2.5 uL Mg) added
	All 5 uL to 8uL of MT100 seeds from  8<br>1 (not diluted seeds) to make 13 uL with 15 uM free tubulin, incubated at 37℃ for 1 hour
<br>imaged after 1 hr polymerization <br> there was nucleation but seeds didn’t grow longer (imaged 100x dilution and taxol)
<br>Left the concentrated seeds and tubulin 15 uM in the incubator at 37℃ overnight
<br>Also left the 100x dilution in the incubator overnight

<br><br>8-5
<br>Repolymerization/continuous polymerization: 
<br> began with 1 aliquot of tubulin split into 2
	3.5 uL BRB80, 1.75 uL kept for polymerization and the other stored in ice for later.<br>	<br>Growth Buffer with 7.5 uL glycerol,2.5 uLMg, 1uL GTP
	Added 1.375 uL Growth Buffer to the 1.75 uL tubulin aliquot, polymerized for 1 hour at 37℃
      <br>for 2nd polymerization, added half of remaining tubulin to polymerized tubulin (final concentration free tubulin ~ 17uM) took out 0.5 uL for squash.
      <br> took out 1 uL for squash, added 0.875 uL (remaining tubulin) as well as 0.625 uL modified growth buffer contained 0.4 uL Mg and 0.16 uL GTP, 0.065 uL BRB80
	<br>warmed all components for 1<br>2 min in water bath before adding final free tubulin 12.5 uM in 4 uL
	<br>incubated at 37℃ for 1 hour 
      <br>Gave up on continuous polymerization because the Microtubules were still short after 3rd polymerization step.
	<br>diluted seeds from 3rd step ~1:100 in new tubulin solution
	<br> 1 aliquot tubulin, 13.1 uL growth buffer(no dmso or glycerol) 0.2 uL seeds (15 uM tubulin) put in 37℃ for 1 hour, also put seeds back at 37℃.

<br><br>8-8
<br>Imaged Microtubules made 8-5

<br><br>8-15
<br>Polymerized Hylite Tubulin, incubated at 37℃ for 30 min
<br> Polymerized rhodamine tubulin 20 mg/ml with GMPCPP at 1mM (2.5 ul GMPCPP (10mM stock) in 25 ul GB), 37℃ for 1 hr
<br>Diluted rhodamine GMPCPP seeds into new tubulin at 20 uM (10x dilution)
<br>1 uL seeds and 9ul growth buffer, growth buffer had just BRB80, GTP, Mg at standard concentrations.
<br>Incubated at 37℃ for 2 hours
<br>Diluted seeds did not continue to grow

<br><br>8-16
<br>Imaged seeds from 8<br>15 at 10:30 AM after incubating at 37℃ overnight. Seeds have not grown more and there were tubulin clumps
<br>Polymerized Hylite tubulin in standard growth buffer at 37℃ for 30 min, made MT50 and imaged 4x dilution (MT200)

<br>Repeated seeding protocol from 8-1
<br> 1 aliquot tubulin and 6.25 uL glycerol growth buffer, polymerized @ 37℃ for ~90 min (10:10<br>11:40)
<br> New tubulin aliquot, added 6 uL standard growth buffer with no DMSO (23uL BRB80 + 1uL GTP + 1uL Mg). 3 uL new tubulin mixed into 5 uL old tubulin. Final concentration 15uM. Iced and vortexed new tubuli, separated 3 uL and placed that in incubator for ~4 min before adding
<br> Incubated at 37℃ for ~1 hour 40 min (11:50 <br>1:30)

<br> Added 3 uL standard Growth Buffer to remaining 2 uL tubulin, iced and vortexed and pre-warmed for 2 min then added 0.5 ul of seeds. Incubated at 37℃ for 2 hrs(2:00<br>4:00). Left seeds and diluted seeds in incubator overnight

<br><br>8-17
<br>Followed the same procedure as 8<br>16 but used rhodamine tubulin for the first step  and hylite tubulin for the second and third steps
<br>hylite tubulin polymerized off of seeds and produced longest microtubules observed thus far

<br><br>8-18
<br>Reused seeds(rhodamine) from 8<br>17 
<br>First polymerized in 15 uM Hylite tubulin:
<br>added 5 uL growth buffer(no DMSO) to Hylite tubulin aliquot
<br>removed 3 uL more growth buffer to the remaining 2 uL hylite tubulin to make 5uL of 15 uM
<br>added 0.5 uL seeds from yesterday
<br>incubated at 37℃ for ~ 4 hours(starting ~ 9:30 AM)

<br>Next polymerized with Hylite and unlabeled tubulin:
<br>Combined remaining 3 uL hylite tubulin with 5 uL of unlabeled(50uM) to create final solution of 46.25uM
<br>added 0.2 uL Mg to the new tubulin solution(unlabeled already has 1mM GTP)
<br>added 3.5 uL new tubulin to remaining 4 uL of polymerized seed solution resulting in 7.5 uL of 21.58 uM tubulin.
(note that we intended to have 15 uM but I made a calculation error. 15 uM would be ~2uL of new tubulin solution added to the diluted seed solution)
<br>Polymerized again with hylite and unlabeled tubulin:
	<br>added 3uL of remaining hylite and unlabeled tubulin to polymerized tubulin (~5.5uL polymerized remaining). Final concentration of tubulin = 16 uM

<br><br>8-19
<br>Imaged Hylite and unlabeled tubulin Microtubules from 8<br>18.
<br>Both MT20 and MT100 showed no visible microtubules, just large clumps of fluorescence (probably hylite tubulin)</p><br>
