        <h4>Hello!</h4>
            Welcome to the Project Wiki for Tube Tech! We're a team based out of <a href="http://orion.bme.columbia.edu/hess/">Hess Laboratory at Columbia University's Biomedical Engineering Department</a>.<br><br> This summer, we designed a protocol that produces <strong> EXCEPTIONALLY LONG MICROTUBULES!</strong> For details on our team, please check out the links below:

           <p>7-20
<br>polymerized tubulin and made mt100
<br>sheared the mt 100 solution using Hess/Jeune-Smith protocol. 250 uL of mt100 was passed through a 25 gauge needle with 1 mL syringe 5 times.
<br>we imaged both sheared and unsheared microtubules under the microscope. There was no considerable difference between sheared and unsheared microtubule lengths.

7-21
<br>  microtubules sheared 7-20 were sheared again. They appeared fragmented when imaged.
<br>these sheared microtubules were placed into a  37℃ water bath for 90 minutes.
<br>both sheared and unsheared microtubules were diluted by 5 and the squashes were imaged. 
<br>We also imaged microtubules left to anneal in the water bath. These microtubules did appear to grow.

<br>Seeding experiment<br> we took unsheared mt100 and sheared them using the same procedure. Polymerized 2 aliquots of tubulin with the seeds. Aliquot 1 <br> 12.5 uL mT100(sheared seeds), 1uL GTP, 1 uL Mg, 1.2 DMSO, 9.3 uL BRB80. Aliquot2 <br>  12.5 uL MT100(sheared seeds), 1uL GTP, 1 uL Mg, and 10.5 BRB80. Both aliquots were left to polymerize for 90 min.
 <br> After analyzing the data the unsheared microtubules had an average length of 13um, sheared twice 6um, seeded without dmso 9um, seeded with dmso 17um. 


7-25
<br>We attempted to replicate the seeding experiment protocol outlined in the Mitchison and Kirschner paper on dynamic instability of microtubule growth(1984) with the hope that we may be able to repeat their results and increase average microtubule length to 30-40um.
<br>Seeding Experiment #2 <br> 1)  we polymerized tubulin using standard polimerization buffer, 8 ul for 1 aliquot of tubulin(final tubulin concentration of 25uM) at 37℃ for 30 min. <br> 2) We then imaged a squash of the mt100 to see if the tubules had grown. <br> 3) We used another aliquot of tubulin, this time with 13.33 ul polymerization buffer and no DMSO(just Mg,and GTP in BRB80), added buffer then incubated in ice for 5 min, then added 1.33 ul of seeds from the 25 ul polymerized earlier.(final tubulin 15 uM in solution), then set in 37℃ water bath for 30 min.

<br>After analyzing the images using Fiesta the average mt100 lengths before seeding were 11.56 um and 10.54 um(taken from 2 images of the same solution). The mt100 lengths after seeding were 9.097 um and 9.326 um. In trying to replicate the results of this experiment, our resulting microtubules were on average 1um shorter. We were expecting to achieve a growth of up to 30-40um. 
<br>In the original protocol from the Kirshner paper glycerol was added to the polymerization buffer. Adding glycerol may yield desired growth.

7-27
<br>Repeated seeding experiment from 7-25 with a few changes. We used a mixture of hylite and rhodamine labeled tubulin. Microtubules seeds were made from hylite tubulin and added to rhodamine tubulin. We suspected that if the rhodamine grows using the hylite seeds, we will be able to directly measure its effectiveness by using different laser frequencies from the microscope.
<br>seeds were produced at 32 uM tubulin (6.25 Growth Buffer) for first polymerization, diluted to 15 uM for second polymerization. Allowed first polymerization to run at 37℃ for 30 min, second for 1 hour
<br>squash of hylite seeds showed long MTs.
<br>squash of hylite seeds and Rhodamine tubulin post<br>seeding showed only rhodamine microtubules<br>no hylite seeds visible under 647 Tirf
<br>Hylite seeds may break down naturally over time, also possible that immersing in ice caused breakdown

7-28
<br>repeated same seeding procedure mentioned 7/27/16 with a few changes<br>
1.	In order to more closely replicate the Mitchison paper, we pre-warmed the tubulin before adding the seeds<br>
2.	This time the seeds were made with rhodamine tubulin and were added to hylite tubulin. Rhodamine tubulin was polymerized in 6.25 uL growth buffer for 30 min. After polymerization 6uL of taxol was added. 1.33 uL rhodamine seeds were added to 13.33uL growth buffer and hylite tubulin polymerized at 37℃ for 30 min

<br>when we viewed our seeds, we noticed that they were mostly broken down and shorter than before.(It is possible that hylite polymerizes better)
<br>We could not observe rhodamine tubulin attached to hylite tubulin
<br>In order to more closely recreate the original paper we will add glycerol to the growing seeds
